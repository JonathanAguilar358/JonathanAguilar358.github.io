                <p>You (Isabella) are the one chosen by demons to be in charge of the orphanage. The demons force you to take care of the children and make the children as smart as possible, so that the kids can be served as food for the demons. You bring the children to the demons to eat and lie to the children saying that those who leave the orphange are being adopted by a loving family.</p>
